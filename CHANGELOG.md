All notable changes to this plugin. Newest first.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Renamed `financial-ui-personas` skill to `financial-ui-styles` (folder, plugin metadata, all prose). `Style` replaces `Persona` throughout. Reinstall required.
- Style Index in styles SKILL.md dropped the stale Status column (all 10 styles ship the same depth).
- "How to Pick" replaced the GraphViz decision tree with a clean audience → style table.
- Patterns SKILL.md gained Tailwind v4 (`@theme`) form alongside the v3 (`tailwind.config.ts`) form.
- README install section now shows GitHub `git clone` form in addition to local path.
- README adds a Scope section clarifying React + Tailwind in examples; rules are framework-agnostic.

Bloomberg workspace pattern reskinned for serious retail.
